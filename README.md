# CustomAndroidCountdownTimer

This is a custom timer to replace the Android CustomTimer class.
It removes the delay when the stock CustomerTimer class completes a lap as well as adds functionality
such as start, pause, resume, and stopping the clock. It also maintains a count of how many laps it completed.
